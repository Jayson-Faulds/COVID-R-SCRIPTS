# COVID-R-SCRIPTS
During the quarantine, I have been reading/practicing like crazy. Here are some R scripts that I used

So this is something a little bit different. During the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020, I have been stuck in my home and jobless. So, while on the job hunt, I have also turned into the reading fiend. While attempting to get a job, I am currently also trying to improve my skills. Part of this involves reading up on data science and techniques in R. A lot of the books I've been reading have really good content, and I've been coding along with the chapters to try and learn them. I figured I might as well post these scripts on GitHub. None of these scripts are my own, they are from the books I have been reading. The chapters all have way more code than what I am uploading, but I only included the snippets that I wasn't completely familiar with. Below I will list all the books that I took code from:
